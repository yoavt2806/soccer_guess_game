# Game Instructions:

1. To find the correct players, the user has five guesses (in each session, we choose a random one).
2. All fields should be presented for each guess (age, team, etc.) and fill them with green for right guess and grey for wrong guess.
3. When the user guess the right player you should present a success message: "You're right! the right player is $RIGHT_PLAYER_NAME$"
4. If the number of guesses ends before the user guesses the right player you should present a failure message: "You lost! maybe next time"
